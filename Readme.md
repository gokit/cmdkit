Cmdkit
--------------
Cmdkit provides a simple commandline library with zero outside dependency, using 
internal libraries as much as possible. It's geared towards a simple API.

If you need broader functionality then I would encourage you to use more robust libraries.

## Install

```
go get -u github.com/gokit/cmdkit
